It's the first day of school at Gensokyo High, a magician-youkai academy. The air is filled with the promise of a youthful high school life, with the hopes of gaining more knowledge along the way about the mysteries of this land.

(dream segment?)

You wake up and look at the time on your Nitori-powered clock.
(Oh Shizuha autumn goddess, I overslept!)
You rush to wear your clothes and head off.

You make a run for it.
And suddenly...
**バッタン!!** (BUMP!!)
You bump into a girl wearing unusual gothic lolita attire.
"Ow.."
"Sorry, are you okay?" you apologise.
"Please watch where you're going, human," she calmly warned.
"Sorry," you reply again and you two go your separate ways.

Still thinking about that girl you just bumped into throughout your walk, you finally reach the school gate.
A muscular red-haired Chinese woman stands against the wall of the school gate, with her head facing downwards as if she's about to doze off. As you approach the gate she suddenly raises her head,
"(*yawn*) Good Meilin- Morning, late are we?"
"Ah, sorry, I slept a bit too much, 'morning."
"That's fine, young man. A lil' sleep don't hurt anybody (*chuckles*). Good day to you!"

...

Later in class you notice that that same girl you bumped into this morning is always by herself and it makes you wonder why people avoid her.

One day you're walking around the corridor bored and looking for a club to join, when you hear angry bird and cat noises coming from a clubroom.
**クエー!!** (CAW!!)
**ニャア!!** (MREEOOW!!)
You look into the door window.
The club looks devoid of members besides all the animals that reside in it. It's just that girl looking depressed with her pet cat and raven who are seemingly fired up about something.
You hear her sigh to the animals, "It's useless, my reputation is ruined forever," with her head in her hands.
You slide the door open, "Sorry for interrupting, but is there something wrong?"
"It's nothing, move along please," she gestures for you to leave.
You turn around a bit to put your hand on the sliding door, ready to leave, but before that you ask: "While i was passing by I heard you saying something about your reputation..? Sorry to hear that... Why are the animals angry?"
She looks at you with a sad look in her eyes and says "I'm talking to my pets right now and they're telling me to be more sociable."
"Wow, you can talk to animals, that's cool. So, about your reputation?"
"There are rumors going on that I can read people's minds and many people are put off by it."
"But youkai have all sorts of abilities, right? So what sets you apart?" you ask.
"I freak people out because I can see their deepest, darkest thoughts... You're afraid too, right?"
"...Well.. it's certainly a curious ability, but my family has dealt with a lot of youkai so I can't say I'm *that* surprised."
