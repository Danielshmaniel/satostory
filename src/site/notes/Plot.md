- [[Dialogue/1. First Day\|1. First Day]]: Two Fateful Meetings (remi wink)
	- (Potential symbolic dream segment)
	- Wake up late for the first day
	- Bump into a girl on your way to school
	- Enter the school
	- Go to class and meet the students and teacher
	- Notice that same girl you bumped into is always by herself
	- Look for a club, Pet Club catches your attention (CAW + NYAA + sadori) and you talk to this girl
